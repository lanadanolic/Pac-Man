Creating a Project Written in Java

A game called "Pacman" was created, where the player collects "food" while other characters in the game, the "ghosts," move randomly around the map. Pacman has 3 lives and loses 1 life each time he encounters a ghost. Once the player completes a level, they progress to the next one, continuing the game with the remaining lives. If the player loses all lives, they are sent back to the first level. The game is controlled using the arrow keys on the keyboard.
